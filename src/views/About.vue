			<p>HI EVERYONE!  Thank you for taking a few minutes out of your hectic schedule to visit our website! Feel free to grab a cup of coffee, sit down, relax, and browse the site! We hope that you like what you see here at J.A.K KENNEL! We are State of Wisconsin licensed and inspected! Dog Seller Breeding License #: 274480-DS. We are also an Accredited Business with the Wisconsin Better Business Bureau. </p>

			<p>J.A.K Kennel is located in the west central part of Wisconsin. We live in the country of a very small town with a population of only 550 and we absolutely love the seclusion in this part of good 'ol Wisconsin. We bought our first Shiba back in 2002 and since then, our interest in Shiba's has grown. Our Shiba's are well socialized with other dogs, ourselves, and our young children. We offer several litters of Shiba Inu Puppies throughout the year, so we most likely will have what you're looking for to suit your needs. </p>

			<p>Most of our breeding stock are raised by us so we know that they get the love and care they deserve. We sell our puppies as pets but we are dedicated to producing top quality dogs so they may also be used for both showing and breeding. We are a smaller kennel so we have time for each and every one of them. We alternate when the females have litters so moms have time to rest. This also helps to keep moms and puppies healthy!</p>
			


			<p>In 2013, Jeff took interest in weight Pulling with our Alaskan Malamute, Max. Check out the pics under the Weight Pulling tab. We also have a couple of sled teams of Siberian Husky's and Malamute's run by Jeff, and Brianna has her own team as well. </p>
			
			<p>On a personal note, we like to be active!  Along with taking care of our dogs and weight pulling, we have a HUGE garden that is about 15' wide by 2.5 acres long running east and west, and the same distance along the back running north and south; which is where you will find me most of the summer. We're all about being All-Natural and rediscovering the traditional value of doing and making things ourselves, naturally, from homemade cooked meals to sunscreen, from toothpaste to cleaners and everything in-between! We're very active in our church, school, community and the communities around us, and we love to travel.</p>
			
			<p>Blessings to you and your family and thanks for checking us out!</p>
			
			<p>Please don't hesitate to call and leave a message or email us. We will respond to all inquiries that evening if not sooner!  All of our contact information is located on the "Contact Us" page. </p>
			
			<p>Summer of 2013 - Jeff, Brianna, and Jonah.</p>
